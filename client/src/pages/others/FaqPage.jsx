              Why should I use Qwikcilver App for generating gift cards and
              e-refunds?

              What are the business benefits of using the Qwikcilver App to
              issue gift cards and e-refunds to customers?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The following are the five main benefits for promoting gift card as
            a product on your online store:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Merchant receives upfront money for a service to be rendered at a
              later date
            </li>
            <li>
              Guaranteed uplift (or spends over-and-above the gift card value),
              on every redemption transaction
            </li>
            <li>
              New prospective customers and referrals (through personal &amp;
              corporate gifting using gift cards)
            </li>
            <li>Prospect of bulk revenues (from large rewards catalogs)</li>
            <li>Chances of gift cards going un-redeemed (called breakage)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The following are the five main benefits for having e-refunds OR
            store-credit program:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Store-Credits can help D2C merchants manage and track refunds more
              efficiently
            </li>
            <li>
              For COD Orders that need to be refunded, an e-refund or
              store-credit is more convenient and cost effective than a bank
              transfer / bank cheque. No need to collect bank details from
              customers.
            </li>
            <li>
              For Pre-paid Orders that needs to be refunded, e-refunds or
              store-credits can help merchants retain the cash flow from the
              original order
            </li>
            <li>
              By retaining the customer, the merchant can also save on the
              entire gamut of costs, that would have originally been incurred
              for acquiring and servicing the customer
            </li>
            <li>
              E-refunds are credited instantly to customers, for use immediately
              on the next order, thereby ensuring customer delight and
              stickiness

              to Qwikcilver?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            While registering on the Qwikcilver App, a merchant needs to provide
            the Business PAN number, CIN Number, GST Number and the Billing /
            Communication address.
          </p>
        </li>

            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the merchant completes the subscription payment, Qwikcilver
            strives to set up the merchant on its systems as quickly as
            possible. This initial configuration usually is done under 1 to 2
            hours.

            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            By virtue of the Qwikcilver app’s integration with the Shopify
            Platform, the gift card SKU’s created on the Qwikcilver dashboard
            will appear as a product SKU in the merchant’s Shopify dashboard.
            Please ensure the Gift Card SKU status is set as “Active”, in your
            Shopify dashboard, to ensure visibility on the online store.

              Are gift cards a taxable product in India? What is the tax rate I
              should set for gift card as a product / SKU on my online store?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In India, gift cards and gift vouchers are not considered as goods
            or services, and no GST is levied when they are sold by a merchant.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are operating in India, you should set the tax rate for gift
            cards sold on your online store to 0%. However, as a responsible
            merchant, please ensure to update this tax rate in line with the
            latest government regulations. Please also consult your taxation
            advisor for further clarity on this aspect. Qwikcilver will not be
            responsible for any tax complications &amp; liabilities arising from
            your non- compliance with government regulations on gift cards.

          </p>
          <p>
            To set-up a tax override from your Shopify admin dashboard, go to
            Settings &gt; Taxes and duties. Please also go through the Shopify’s

            </strong>

          <p>
            Once your Gift Card SKU is active on the Shopify dashboard, your
            customers can easily search and discover the gift card SKU. However,
            to aid the discovery of your gift card SKU, please add the same to
            your product navigation menu. Our merchants get higher gift card
            sales, on promoting the product through site banners and special
            pages.

            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Customers have the following two options to purchase the gift cards:
          </p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              Buy-for-Self: Customers who want to use gift cards for
              self-consumption on the merchant store, can use this option.
              Purchasing a gift card using this option will automatically add
              the gift card, to an online wallet, that Qwikcilver maintains on
              behalf of the merchant. All gift cards in the customer’s online
              wallet can be redeemed as part of the Shopify Check-Out flow.
            </li>
            <li>
              Send-As-A-Gift: Customers who want to send the gift cards to
              friends and family can use this option. Here the customer must
              enter the recipient’s email details, and the gift card is securely
              delivered to the recipient via email.
            </li>

          </p>
          <p>
            To ensure greater security and convenience for your customers, the
            Qwikcilver app creates a secure gift card wallet for your customers
            to store gift cards received from family, friends and other entities
            (i.e. Employers, Corporate Promotions etc). Customers can simply add
            the Gift Card Code, received on email to get the gift card added to
            the wallet.

            <strong>What is the billing cycle for a merchant?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            A merchant that is onboarded during the middle of the month is
            billed on a pro-rata basis. Thereafter the merchant is billed in
            calendar month cycles.

            <strong>How does my subscription plan work?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Qwikcilver has a very transparent pricing plan that allows merchants
            to issue gift cards &amp; store-credits for their customers:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Each subscription plan (for example: Basic Plan of Rs. 399) allows
              the merchant to issue gift cards up-to a certain limit (for
              example: Rs. 20,000).
            </li>
            <li>
              Gift Card and Store-credit issuances beyond the Subscription limit
              are charged separately, at a fixed Usage rate (For example: This
              usage rate for the Basic Plan is at 2.5%).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The feature differences across the plans are detailed on the App

            to <a href="mailto:care@qwikcilver.com">care@qwikcilver.com</a>.

            <strong>How can I cancel my subscription plan?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event where a merchant wants to discontinue using the
            Qwikcilver App, the merchant can cancel the subscription from the
            Qwikcilver App dashboard.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>When will the cancellation come into effect?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Cancel of Subscription always comes to effect from the subsequent
            month onwards.

              What are the implications of uninstalling the Qwikcilver app from
              the Shopify account?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Uninstalling the Qwikcilver app will prevent your legitimate
            customers from redeeming their gift card on your online store.
            Please note that customers can initiate litigation proceedings in
            case the store credits and gift cards issued to them are not honored
            by the merchant.
          </p>
          <p>
            In case you want to discontinue using the Qwikcilver app, you can
            cancel the subscription plan from the app dashboard.

            Qwikcilver, to avoid business disruptions for the merchants.
